# AlgoCoach

## Description

AlgoCoach is a cross-platform educational application designed to help users learn algorithmic concepts and practice coding problems in a streamlined, intuitive interface. Users can select an algorithm topic, and AlgoCoach will display a concept explanation generated by ChatGPT and a list of relevant Leetcode problems with links. The app fetches content from a database, with missing topics dynamically generated by AI when needed. AlgoCoach runs across all major platforms, including Web, Desktop, iOS, and Android.
